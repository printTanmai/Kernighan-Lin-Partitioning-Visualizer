# Kernighan-Lin-Partitioning-Visualizer
This project implements the Kernighan-Lin graph partitioning algorithm and visualizes the results using Tkinter and NetworkX. It partitions a graph into two groups to minimize cut size, with an interactive UI to visualize nodes, edges, and partitions. Customizable for various graph configurations.
